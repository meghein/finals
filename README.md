## Sure Sheets
 
Sure Sheets is a system for taking your underutilized screenshots and capturing that all-important textual data for use in an infographic-styled sheet. Whether you’re trying to study or just trying to keep track of those meeting minutes from a lazy Friday afternoon, you can count on NERv05 and TESS to help you organize your work.
 
Created by Meg Hein, Bryan Gomes, and Charlie Hayes in conjunction with Lighthouse Labs.
 
Sure Sheets provides you with two bots and some templates. TESS, our language bot, will extract language and help you import pictures (should you need them) into your sheet, while NERv05, our chatbot, waits ready to help guide you through the rest of our straightforward creation process. Click through our templates to choose one to your liking, import your elements, maybe change up some colors if you like, and make something you can be proud to show off--even if it’s just there for your own personal reference and studying needs.
 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
