## Sure Sheets

A system for taking those unwanted screenshots and capturing that all-important textual data for use in an infographic styled sheet that you can proudly say kept your hopes and dreams of remembering that lecture (or meeting) alive.

Created by Meg Hein, Bryan Gomes and Charlie Hayes in conjuction with Lighthouse Labs.

We provide you with two bots and some templates. Tess, our language bot, will extract language and help you import pictures (should you need them) into your sheet, while NERv05, our chatbot, waits ready to help guide you through the process. Click through our templates to choose one to your liking, import your elements, maybe change up some colors if you like, and make something you can be proud to show off, even if itâ€™s just there for your reference and studying needs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
